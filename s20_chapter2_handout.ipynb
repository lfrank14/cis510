I can also tell you that it is kind of a throw-away variable. We use it in the loop and then don't care about it anymore. Why I believe it is confusing is because behind the scenes, not seen by you, Python is messing with it. Here is the motivation. When I am playing music, I have to remember where I am on the repeats. If it is the first time through, then I repeat. If it is the second time through, I don't repeat. Even I can generally remember whether first or second. But what if I had to repeat 3 times? I could probably remember. What about 10 times? Getting tricky. Python tries to be helpful by giving you a way to see how many times you have repeated. It shows you in steves_index.

But happy to answer questions about the code if you are curious. In particular, if you squint, you have an outer loop which is similar to the \"create a new list from an old list\". The difference is the new list is actually a new column in the table. The inner loop is again the pattern \"create a new list from an old list\". So what is new is seeing loop patterns nested in each other."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"ZziR7Xh3hQ8a","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["letter_list = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z']  #new features, i.e. column names"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"hGHMJ7teh5vk","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["for i in range(len(letter_list)):\n","  letter = letter_list[i]  #'a' then 'b' then 'c', etc.\n","\n","  #create a new list from old list - so this is like your gist, just embedded inside another loop\n","  the_counts = []\n","\n","  #Note this loop indented so nested\n","  for j in range(len(name_list)):\n","    name = name_list[j]\n","    lower_name = name.lower()\n","    letter_count = lower_name.count(letter)\n","    the_counts.append(letter_count)\n","\n","  #now back in outer loop, which is kind of like trimmed_table['Length'] = name_lengths\n","  trimmed_table[letter] = the_counts  #add a new column with values\n"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"GtfHWWAejc-G","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":238},"outputId":"c5314362-8726-46d5-940f-a546191bb4c6","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1586369211910,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":349,"user":{"displayName":"Lea Frank","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GgOE2jMYsKFpFOM8jYIyScAm7egnmTjn2lEvC_nsg=s64","userId":"08227243406069908054"}}},"source":["trimmed_table.head()"],"execution_count":23,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>Survived</th>\n","      <th>Name</th>\n","      <th>a</th>\n","      <th>b</th>\n","      <th>c</th>\n","      <th>d</th>\n","      <th>e</th>\n","      <th>f</th>\n","      <th>g</th>\n","      <th>h</th>\n","      <th>i</th>\n","      <th>j</th>\n","      <th>k</th>\n","      <th>l</th>\n","      <th>m</th>\n","      <th>n</th>\n","      <th>o</th>\n","      <th>p</th>\n","      <th>q</th>\n","      <th>r</th>\n","      <th>s</th>\n","      <th>t</th>\n","      <th>u</th>\n","      <th>v</th>\n","      <th>w</th>\n","      <th>x</th>\n","      <th>y</th>\n","      <th>z</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>Braund, Mr. Owen Harris</td>\n","      <td>2</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>2</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>4</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>Cumings, Mrs. John Bradley (Florence Briggs Th...</td>\n","      <td>2</td>\n","      <td>2</td>\n","      <td>2</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>4</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>3</td>\n","      <td>2</td>\n","      <td>2</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>2</td>\n","      <td>2</td>\n","      <td>3</td>\n","      <td>2</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>5</td>\n","      <td>3</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>2</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>Heikkinen, Miss.
