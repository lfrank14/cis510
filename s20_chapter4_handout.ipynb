Assume we can build a good algorithm for predicting who will perish and who will survive among Titanic passengers. So we are good at choosing 0 or 1 for the Survived column. Now we invent time travel :) We teleport back in time to when passengers were actually boarding the Titanic's sister ship, the Brittanic, launched after the Titanic sunk. We stand at the gangplank and ask each passenger their name. We plug that into our algorithm and advise them to either (a) board because we predict they will survive or (b) wait until trans-Atlantic passenger flights are invented (because we predict they will perish).\n","\n","It so happens the Brittanic did sink with loss of life!\n","\n","I'll let you work on the time-travel paradox on your own :)\n","\n","In summary, we are using something we know about the past to build an algorithm that will predict the future."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Nsfi5TWrLJZ0","colab_type":"text"},"source":["##What type of problem are we solving?\n","\n","We are fortunate to have the outcomes for the Titanic passengers as captured in the `Survived` column. This column has a more generic name, the *label* column. It labels each row/passenger with the outcome we want to predict. Given we have labels, we can use a type of machine-learning called *supervised learning*. In this course we will focus on supervised learning problems, i.e., we will look at data with a label column.\n","\n","What if we did not have the Survived column? Somehow the record was lost or no one ever recorded it in the first place. We can still make progress using a style called *unsupervised machine learning*. I'd love to look at this in the course but 10 weeks is not much time.\n","\n","What if we have just a few examples that are labeled? Maybe we know the outcome of 10 passengers. Typically you need lots of labeled data for supervised learning and 10 is not enough. Are we stuck with unsupervised learning? There have been some cool advances that allow you to kind of combine supervised and unsupervised learning into something called *one-shot* or *few-shot* learning. Way cool. But not sure we can get to it in 10 weeks.\n","\n","Summary:\n","\n","* If you have labeled data, and typically lots of it, you can use *supervised* learning methods.\n","\n","* If you have no labeled data, you can use *unsupervised* learning methods.\n","\n","* If you have a small amount of labeled data, you can use *one-shot* or *few-shot* learning.\n","\n","We fall under supervised machine learning: we have labeled passenger data."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"h4_mgvvQOCbl","colab_type":"text"},"source":["#2. The problem of overfitting\n","<img src='https://www.dropbox.com/s/9fcc1crlxp19ijt/major_section.png?raw=1' width='300'>\n","\n","The way I have the problem set up, we are using Titanic data to make predictions about Brittanic passengers. But we have never seen the Brittanic passengers (unless some Titanic survivors were foolish enough to now board the Brittanic). The problem is that when using supervised learning algorithms, we have the tendency to \"memorize\" the labeled data we have. So we are really good at predicting Titanic passengers, post hoc. But our algorithms can be fragile when looking at new data, e.g., Brittanic passengers. Memorizing the labeled data falls into a category of problems called *overfitting*. We need to mitigate the overfitting problem."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"50vmHG_bPUbn","colab_type":"text"},"source":["#Ways to mitigate overfitting\n","\n","This seems kind of hard. All we have is the Titanic data. We don't know what the Brittanic data will look like. How can we avoid overfitting the Titanic data? How about this? We carve out a piece of the Titanic data and treat it like the Brittanic data. So when we build our prediction algorithm, we ignore the piece we carved out. Once we have built our algorithm, we test it out on the data we held out. This is not perfect, but might give us a more realistic view of the accuracy of our algorithm on new data.\n","\n","Jargon:\n","\n","* When we split the Titanic data into two pieces, we call one *traning data* and the other *testing data*. Or training set and testing set.\n","\n","* The machine learning *algorithms* we will look at in this course include KNN (this chapter) and Naive Bayes (later chapters). We might get to Artifical Neural Nets (ANN). All of these are algorithms. All are prone to overfitting.\n","\n","* A *model* is an algorithm paired with training data.

It has the benefit of being simple. It has the drawback of removing (likely valuable) data from your training set. If you are starting with too little labeled data to start with (a typical occurence), now you are subtracting even more. Could lead to *underfitting*! We will discuss remedies to this later. For now, let's get to holdout.\n","\n","First question: how much to holdout for testing? 50%? Too much? How much you decide to holdout is question you have to answer as a data scientist. For now, we will hold out 30%.\n","\n","BTW: overfitting leads to what you might hear as *variance errors*. We have too much variance and can get lost in irrelevant details. Underfitting leads to bias errors. We have too few data points and we will be overly-biased by the few we have.\n","\n","Let's bring in our wrangled data now.

You can see that in my code above: `up.knn(test_values_0, training_passengers_matrix, training_labels, 5, 'euclidean')`. I designated I wanted to use the 'euclidean' similarity measure. The choice of the similarity measure to use is another *hyperparameter*. Are there alternatives? Yes. And in fact, there is a more preferred measure for dealing with text problems: *cosine similarity*. Let's look at this diagram again.\n","\n","<img src='https://www.dropbox.com/s/7rtuzw37hgl1oi8/ed_vs_cos.png?raw=1' height=300>\n","\n","We know that d represents the euclidean distance. But you also see the greek letter theta that measures an angle. We got the angle by drawing 2 lines both starting at (0,0). One line goes to A and the other line goes to B. What I want to do is measure the cosine of the angle (theta) that I get when I draw these lines.\n","\n","We are now moving into Trigonometry space so have new jargon. The lines are called *vectors*. I find it all kind of interesting. Nothing has really changed on our side. We have 2 lists of numbers. But we can take different mathematical perspectives (Geometry, Trigonometry) to get more abstract views. And this gives us mathematical tools we can use. Cool.\n","\n","I know you probably have the formula for the cosine of theta sribbled somewhere from your math courses.

I am pretty sure I knew this from my high school algebra class :)\n","\n","The jargony description of the left-hand version of the formula is for the **numerator** we are taking the *dot-product* of 2 vectors and for the **denominator** we are using the *L2 norms* of the 2 vectors (parallel bars around A and B). The formula is nice because you can see how the jargony terms translate into algebra and things we know how to do in pure Python, e.g., loop over lists. I can also tell you that `numpy` knows how to deal with the dot-product and L2 norms directly. So when you import numpy, you bring in another abstraction level, one that knows about *linear algebra* (jargony term for what the formula on left uses for notation).\n","\n","##Whew.\n","\n"," Lots of concepts floating around.
