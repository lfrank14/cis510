The `O` stands for one of the \"classes\" we are using. We have 3 classes, right? EAP, MWS, HPL. So the O stands for one of them. It is a parameter to the formula. We have to fill it in before we start computing it.\n","It may be best to view `P(O|E1, E2 ...)` as a Python function call. We have to fill in values for O and all the Es.\n","\n","2.

What we want to do is compute all 3 formulas above to get 3 different values. The 3 values we get are the probabilities that the sentence belongs to each of the 3 respective classes. The way the formula is set up, these probablities are normalized to add to 1.\n","\n","3. What are the values for `E1, E2`, etc.? They are the words in the sentence. More precisely, they are the spacy tokens that meet `is_aplha` and `not is_stop`. So we parse our sentence in normal fashion to get the tokens and view these tokens as E1, E2, etc. You will see that we don't care what order the tokens come in. We are ignoring their context of usage. They are just a collection (bag) of tokens. You can assign the Es to them in any fashion you like.\n","\n","4. It might be best to use a real example at this point. Let's say we are looking at `P(EAP|E1, E2 ...)` and we see the token/word *indefinite* in the parse of the sentence. Let's say E1 = indefinite. On the right-hand side I see this: `P(E1|O)` which maps to `P(indefinite|EAP)`. What this asks informally is \"what is the probablity of seeing the word indefinite in a sentence that EAP wrote?\" In other words, out of all the sentences that EAP wrote, how many times did indefinite show up? Could be zero!\n","\n","5. What else is on the right-hand side? How about this: `P(O)`, or in our case `P(EAP)`. This asks what the probability is that EAP wrote a sentence out of all the (training) sentences we have seen.\n","\n","7. One more: `P(E1)` or `P(indefinite)`. Out of all the sentences written across all 3 authors, how many included `indefinite`?\n","\n","8. Back to the left-hand side. We can read `P(EAP|E1, E2 ...)` as what is the probability that EAP wrote this sentence given the tokens in the sentence, where we label the tokens E1, E2, etc. The Es are our \"evidence\". Given the evidence, we are being Bayesian sleuths, trying to ferret out the culprit (a bit of a strained metaphor).\n","\n","##Now what?\n","\n","We have to figure out how to actually get all these values and do the products and division.

Or maybe he was, don't know. What is meant by naive is an assumption we make to allow us to use the simplified formula we used above. Look at our sentence again:\n","<pre>\n","['laugh', 'oliver', 'grandfather', 'wo', 'ride', 'motor']\n","</pre>\n","which turns into:\n","<pre>\n","P(EAP|'laugh', 'oliver', 'grandfather', 'wo', 'ride', 'motor')\n","</pre>\n","The non-naive way of looking at it is  where we view all terms as dependent on each other, e.g. we can't view `laugh` on its own but only in conjunction with (conditionally on) `oliver`, `grandfather`, etc. The probability-chain rule formula captures this idea. And sorry for 2nd time, I am changing notation once again: O becomes C, E becomes x:\n","<p>\n","<img src='https://www.dropbox.com/s/v2ppatadfghvrb4/chain2.png?raw=1'>\n","<p>\n","All of these probabilities are known to us so we could calculate an answer.  We would need a table that contains all possible combinations of words with their counts, i.e., the powerset. We have 24K unique words. The size of the powerset is `2**N`. So we are looking at a new word_bag table with 2**24000 items. Just as a heads up, here is 2**150:\n","<pre>\n","2**150\t=\t1, 427, 247, 692, 705, 959, 881, 058, 285, 969, 449, 495, 136, 382, 746, 624\n","</pre>\n","Gulp. That's not going to happen unless you bring in a separate database to store all that info.\n","\n","One alternative is to forget the database and just do on-demand counting for each new set of words. But this could be slow if we have to search the entire set of sentences multiple times to get the powerset numbers.\n","\n","To get around the space and computational costs of the formula above (the full chain rule), Smith said let's pretend that all terms are independent of each other. Others said, don't be naive, Smith, you can't assume that terms are totally independent. But Smith persevered. And she was right, the naive assumption does work well in many cases. So Naive Bayes is normal Bayes but with the strong (naive) assumption that all items are independent.\n","<p>\n","Who was Smith? I don't have a definitive answer. But I like her thinking. Try simple first.\n","</div>"]}]}
