In this case, we are talking to the colab operating system. Why? Because the operating system stores the libraries we want. And I am saying remove `up_puddles`. Why? Because I want to make sure I have the freshest version. You will see that a little later I  restore `uo_puddles` directly from my github account. This has the freshest version.

Knowing when one piece of text (e.g., a document) is similar to another piece of text (another document) seems useful. Maybe we are trying to find plagarized political speeches. We could build our 27 element list for each speech. Then follow our steps to get ordered distances.\n","\n","But we have other fish to fry. Our end goal is to predict survival of passengers. And the sorted list gives us a huge headstart on our first machine-learning algorithm called K Nearest Neighbor or simply KNN. See you in next chapter."]}]}
