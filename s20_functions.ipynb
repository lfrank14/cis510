You are \"calling\" on the function to do its thing. The function won't do anything on its own.

The jargony name is that it *binds* the parameters. I think the best way to think of this is as a set of hidden assignment statements. Python knows what the paramters are so, hidden from you, it does:\n","<pre>\n","number_list = argument value\n","</pre>\n","In our case, the argument value is a raw list of floats. So Python does this:\n","<pre>\n","number_list = [.2, .5, .01]\n","</pre>\n","If there were more than one parameter, Python would look for more than one argument so it could assign them all. I think this is one of the most confusing things about functions. These hidden assignments are made before anything else happens.\n","\n","Now Python goes ahead and executes the loop in the body. It will end up with `.001` in the variable `result`.\n","\n","Now the function is ready to give a result back to you. You called on it to do some work, it did that work, and now wants to report what it did. The `return` statement does that reporting. If you forget to include it, the function will kind of throw up its hands and give you a `None` value. So a missing return statement won't cause an error, but it will return something to you that is almost certainly not useful, the special Python value `None`.\n","\n","Let's look at a more complicated example that always seems to be confusing at first."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"eLsFQKkSOOLF","colab_type":"code","outputId":"aabf4667-e134-4385-ee40-7dab55aade67","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1588527990214,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":318,"user":{"displayName":"Stephen Fickas","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GhTYV1e1vE147fD273jIgyMoLcruXBuvDZ3rnvU4Q=s64","userId":"09626902604756862380"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":34}},"source":["x = [.1, .9, 2.3, 4.]\n","z = float_mult(x)\n","z"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["0.8280000000000001"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":6}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"8KmmYn0ipasH","colab_type":"text"},"source":["So same deal.
